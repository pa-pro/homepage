# Homepage

As an aspiring Front-End Developer I have created this interactive homepage as a project for one of the modules of **YouCode Front-End Developer course**, that I'm participating in. 

## What does the homepage consist of?

1. Navigation through sections. 
2. My short bio as a photographer. 
3. Table with photo shoot prices. 
4. The fun part - a couple of JS interaction where you can click the button and change background, header or even remove the button!
